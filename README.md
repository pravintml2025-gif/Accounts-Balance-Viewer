Adra.Infrastructure: Infrastructure layer (EF Core, Repositories, Data access)

Tests: Unit tests (27 tests, all passing)

# Frontend (Angular 18)

File Upload & Processing

Multi-format support: CSV, TSV, Excel (.xlsx)

Detailed reporting: success/error tracking with line-by-line feedback

Admin-only access for uploads

# Assumptions & Notes

Uploads are restricted to predefined accounts listed in the document.

Non-predefined accounts are ignored and not imported.

Each new upload inserts or updates balances for the current month.

If multiple uploads exist for the same month, the last upload is taken as final.

The landing page displays the sum of all balances for the current month.

"View All Records" shows monthly balances with filters by year and month.

Upload Balance Data supports TSV, Excel, and CSV formats.
